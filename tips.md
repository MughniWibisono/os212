# LEARNING TIPS  <br>
***WEEK 05***<br>
1. **Google what you don't know**<br>
   > Always search what you don't know rather than asking your friend for answers, because answers doesn't help you learn the material, but if you know the concept you will   understand what is the material's really about. <br>

2. **Don't procrastinate**<br>
   > Dont delay any of your homework, try to solve it day by day so you won't be so stressed out for so many homeworks. <br>

***WEEK 06***<br>
3. **Dont be afraid to ask**<br>
   > If you're really stuck at something, don't be afraid or shy to ask someone, asking someoen doesn't mean that you don't understand the assignment, it's just mean that you need help, and needing help is normal.
 
4. **Read more**<br>
   > Don't be lazy to read slides, slides can be really usefull
