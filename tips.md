# LEARNING TIPS  <br>
1. **Google what you don't know**<br>
   > Always search what you don't know rather than asking your friend for answers, because answers doesn't help you learn the material, but if you know the concept you will   understand what is the material's really about. <br>

2. **Don't procrastinate**<br>
   > Dont delay any of your homework, try to solve it day by day so you won't be so stressed out for so many homeworks. <br>
